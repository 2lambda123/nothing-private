# Nothing Private [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gautamkrishnar/nothing-private.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gautamkrishnar/nothing-private)

This project demosntrated the ability of a  website to identify and track users, even if they are using **private browsing** or **incognito mode** in their web browsers. Many people think that they can hide their identity if they use private browsing or incognito mode. This project will prove that they are wrong.

## How to use the website

* Visit <http://www.nothingprivate.ml> and enter your name
* Click the **"See the magic"** button
* Visit the same website in Private browsing / Incognito mode
* See the magic :star:

### Don't scroll down and ruin the fun... Just follow the steps above... :smile:

## Hey! How?

Hope you are surprised! :smile: Yes, the website can remember your name even if you had visited it via **private browsing** or **incognito mode**. Yes, nothing is private in this world anymore! This is what the big companies are doing with your identity. You think that going into private mode will wipe out all the traces? **Absolutely not!** In reality, using private browsing or incognito mode will just help you to clear your browsing history. Your internet service provider, search engines, and your favorite websites **can still track you**. They know what you like and dislike. They use your data to earn money. The video below explains everything:

### Some tech stuff

Nothing Private uses the browser fingerprinting feature of [Client.js](https://github.com/jackspirou/clientjs) to obtain the fingerprint of your web browser. When you submit the form, this fingerprint is saved, along with your name, in an SQLite database using PHP as a backend. The next time you visit the website, your browser fingerprint is matched with the column in the database and your name is returned.

Visit [db_server](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/nothing-private/tree/master/db_server) for the server files.
